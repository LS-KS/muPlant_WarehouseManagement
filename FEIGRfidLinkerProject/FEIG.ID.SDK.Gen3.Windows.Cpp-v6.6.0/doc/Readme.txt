===============================
FEIG IDENTIFICATION SDK Gen3

    V6.06.00

	2023-07-24
===============================


1. What is new
The main release notes can be found in section Release Notes of supplied documentation.


2. System Requirements
Please follow the installation guide in section Installation Guide of supplied documentation.


3. First Steps
To become familiar with the FEIG reader families, developers should read first the system manual of the reader.
We recommend to read secondly the FEIG IDENTIFICATION SDK Documentation. The documentation is bundled in the 'FEIG-ID-SDK-DOC' application that can be found in the 'doc' folder.
There is no need to install the 'FEIG-ID-SDK-DOC' application, you can simply run it from within the 'doc' folder.

Please note, that the documentation is only available on x86_64 Windows or Linux systems.

  Special note for Linux users:
  Depending on your distribution and preferred file manager it is not possible to open the documentation by just 'double clicking' on the binary.
  In this case you can simply run the application using the shell. Therefore you have to open a terminal and navigate to the extracted files using 'cd /path/to/the/extracted/documentation/'.
  After this you can open the documentation by running './FEIG-ID-SDK-DOC'.


4. Installation
You can find the installation instructions on the "Getting Started -> Installation Instructions" page of the FEIG IDENTIFICATION SDK Gen3 Documentation


5. Sample projects
You can find sample code for several use cases in the "Getting Started -> Samples" section of the FEIG IDENTIFICATION SDK Gen3 Documentation


NOTE:
FEIG provides a tool called ISOStart+, which demonstrates all capabilities of each reader type.
This tool is a great help for developers to understand the commands, configuration and reader modes of any FEIG IDENTIFICAION reader.
